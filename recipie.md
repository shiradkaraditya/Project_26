Preparation for eggless chocolate cake recipe
Preheat the oven to 170 C or 340 F for at least 15 mins. 
Grease a 8 or 9 inch round cake pan & drizzle some flour on it. or Line with a parchment paper. Set aside.
Mix 1 ½ cups flour, ¼ cup cocoa powder, ½ tsp salt and 1 tsp baking soda.
Sieve the flour mix at least twice to aerate the flour. This makes the cake light.
If using wheat flour then sieve four times.
Add 1 cup sugar and mix it well. I use fine sugar.
If you are using coarse one then you can also dissolve it in 1 cup water (called for the recipe) and pour it in the next step.
How to make eggless chocolate cake
Make a well (space) in the center. Pour 1 cup water, 1/3 cup oil or melted butter, 1 tbsp vanilla extract and 1 tbsp lemon juice or vinegar.
Gently begin to mix well from the liquid ingredients in the center.
Mix just until the flour is combined well with the wet ingredients. Do not over mix.
The batter will be runny. Pour it to the cake pan.
Knock it a few times against the kitchen counter to release air bubbles.
Bake for 25 to 28 mins. Check after 23 mins. The bake time may vary depending on your pan size and oven. So Just bake it until a skewer or a tester inserted comes out clean.
To check if it is completely baked, insert a skewer in the center of the cake and check. It must come out clean.
Keep the cake pan on a wire rack and allow it to cool down for 8 to 10 mins in the pan.
Invert eggless chocolate cake gently on a wire rack. Allow it to cool.
